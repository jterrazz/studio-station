# TODO

Decided with the owner and left for later, each with what starts it.

## The next minor release: the v2 words go
The hidden aliases (`status`, `start`, `stop`, `tools`, `secrets`, `config`,
`storage`, `run`, `probe`, `--always-on`) and `station.status/v1` are kept for
one release ([Commands](docs/reference/commands.md#hidden-aliases)). The next
minor removes them, with the `machines supervise` retirement shim and the
retired preference names (`here`, `hosts`, `services`, `lend_list`), once
`studio doctor` reads `station.overview.read/v1`.

## Choose the secret manager
Bitwarden Secrets Manager or 1Password service accounts, as a second adapter of
`accounts/contract.Vault`. It becomes the home of the secrets shared with a VM
beyond `session:*` (`operator:*` tokens scoped per VM). Starts when a VM first
needs a token that is not a browser session.

## The macOS VM and the iPhone (on the MacBook M5 Pro, from 2026-11-07)
A `macos` image beside `linux`: pull `macos-tahoe-xcode:27`,
`--provisioning-opts` instead of admin/admin, `kern.hv_vmm_present` for the
kind, `station guest` on macOS (`lsof`), a build deployed to the iPhone from a
workspace made `--network bridged` (pairing: cable on the Mac, or Accessory
Access; unproven). No Tailscale inside. Then the recipe and its first boot, and
the apps that live on macOS VMs only (xcode, cocoapods, xcodegen,
android-studio, lens) install there. If the iPhone cannot be reached from the
VM, the owner decides how the install step reaches it (an Xcode on the Mac is
not an option he has accepted).

## Machine test tiers: the nightly
Tiers 2 and 3 are built (`make e2e-machine`, [Test](docs/guides/test.md#the-machine-specs)).
What waits is tier 3 as a nightly on the Mac mini, once a tart VM may run
there.

## The Mac mini as an always-on Mac
Installing station there is the owner's go, never a lot's. When its disk is
upgraded: `station setup --name mac-mini` there, the Always-on Mac settings,
the infrastructure moved from OrbStack to a server (`machines create infra
--server --check https://infra:6443/readyz`), images built there. Ask the
owner before any test on it.

## Long-running agents
Hermes and OpenClaw as long-running VMs on an always-on Mac. Not designed: the
owner still starts them by hand. Their gateway rows were dropped from the
Overview until that design, which may be a machine kind of its own.

## Network isolation
Tart Softnet for VMs that need no LAN. Until then a VM behind its Mac reaches
what its Mac binds on every interface, and the other VMs of its Mac (sshd,
Docker's ports), whatever the Tailscale policy says; the Ports section shows
each as Public when it is.

## Smaller follow-ups
- An image registry (private ghcr) once two Macs build the same image.
- Memory soak: a Linux VM 8 h under load, the Mac's RSS of the VM process.
- `machines edit <vm> --permanent`: turn a throwaway workspace permanent (rewrite its record; the engine reads it).
- HTTPS mode: if a Mac's `tailscale serve` refuses arbitrary https ports, the default of the `ports` group's `https` becomes `path`.
- Remove the old Tailscale leftovers by hand when wanted: the `tag:station-vm` tag owner, the VM-join OAuth client, each Mac's userspace node (admin console), `brew uninstall tailscale` (the formula; the app replaces it).
- The poweroff intent over a FIFO instead of a console file, if the macOS guest's console differs.
- A second `Hypervisor` adapter (Lima, Apple `container`, Virtualization.framework direct) if tart's licence or owner turns bad.
- A second `Notifier` adapter (ntfy, to the phone), and a `Jobs` adapter over systemd for a Linux machine that runs an engine.
- Herdr: `machines create` could run `hc machine add <name> [--temp]`.
