# Commands

Every command of `station`, grouped as `station --help` groups them. The words are the [Glossary](../concepts/glossary.md)'s.

`station help` groups the commands as SPEC v3 §4.1 does: MACHINES (`machines`), ON A MACHINE (`overview`, `apps`, `settings`, `disk`, `ports`, `accounts`, `background`, `power`), A MAC'S IMAGES AND ENGINE (`images`, `engine`), THIS TERMINAL (shown once `use` exists) and STATION ITSELF (`setup`, `help`). The sections below keep their v2 headings until each family takes its v3 words.

## Rules

- Bare `station` opens the TUI on a terminal; piped, or with `--all` or `--json`, it prints `station overview`, exit 0.
- A bare noun lists (`apps`, `settings`, `disk`, `machines`, `ports`, `images`, `accounts`). A verb whose argument is missing is refused, its hint the command with it: `station apps install` hints `station apps install <app>`.
- An existing thing is a positional (`machines stop api`); a new thing is described by options (`machines create api --permanent`).
- The same verbs everywhere: `install`, `uninstall`, `upgrade`, except where a family has taken its v3 words (`apps`: `install`, `update`, `remove`). The only other words are the [hidden aliases](#hidden-aliases).
- Every read takes `--json`. Every destructive action asks on a terminal or takes `--yes`.
- Every refusal exits 2 before any question; every failure is one `Error:` and one `Hint:`. With `--json`, the same refusal or failure is also the `station.error/v1` document on stdout (`schema`, `type`, `code`, `subject`, `message`, `hint`, `fix`), the exit code unchanged. A question answered no is `Error: <what> kept: you said no`, exit 1.
- A word station does not know is `Error: unknown command "<word>"` / `Hint: station help`, exit 2; so is `station help <word>`.
- A word under `disk` that names one of its entries, the verb forgotten, is still refused, but its hint is the command meant: `station disk go` is `"go" is a disk row: say what to do with it`, hint `station disk free go`. Under `apps` the entry is a read: `station apps jq` is jq's detail; under `settings`, a setting's name is its read: `station settings dns`.
- `--on <machine>` runs any command below on another machine of the fleet, through its engine, and renders the answer here; see [Machines](machines.md#on-another-machine).
- `station use <machine>` makes every later command of this terminal run there, as `--on` would; `--on` still wins for one command. See [Machines](machines.md#this-terminals-machine).
- A value a command needs from you is never an argv flag when it could be a secret: a config item asks in a form on a terminal ([Configuration](configuration.md)).

## Here

These commands act on the machine they run on, and list only what its kind allows.

### `station overview`

```sh
station overview [--all] [--json]
```

This machine at a glance (SPEC §5.1): a first line that sums it up (`This Mac · jterrazz-macbook-pro · 5 things need you · Engine running`; a VM's names its kind and how long it has run), then Needs you, every section's findings ranked broken first and then by the one section order, five of them unless `--all`; then one line per section the machine has, in that order (a Mac: Apps, Settings, Disk, Ports, Accounts, Background, Awake, then its VMs; a workspace: the sections it has; a server: Ports and SSH, and `Apps, settings, accounts: not managed by station`); then one or two `→` next steps. Each line is that section's own read, so its counts equal what the section's own command prints. `station overview --on <vm>` and `station machines <vm>` print the same bytes: `On <vm>:`, the VM's first line from its Mac (`linux-1 · Workspace on This Mac · Throwaway · up 2 h`), the sections it reads inside it, then its Health; a VM that does not run, or whose guest does not answer, shows its first line and Health alone. `--json` prints `station.overview.read/v1`: `machine`, `findings[]` (each `fix` one of `call`, `command`, `path`) and `sections[]` with their counts; the hidden alias `station status --json` keeps printing the [`station.status/v1`](status-json.md) document `studio doctor` reads. On a terminal, `overview`, `apps` and `disk` draw every row at once and fill each as its read answers ([instant reads](../concepts/design-system.md#instant-reads)); piped or with `--json` they print one complete document.

### `station apps`

```sh
station apps [<app>] [--all] [--json] # the apps for this machine, by attention; one app's detail
station apps install <app...>
station apps update [<app...> | --method <method>... | --all-machines]
station apps remove <app...> [--yes]
```

The list sums This Mac first (`108 apps for this Mac · 3 updates · 100 not installed`), then groups the apps by attention: Updates, Failed, Not installed, Not managed (`?`: present, but not installed by its catalogue method, the detail saying how it got there), and OK folded; the apps that live on other machines are a count, every row of every group unfolded with `--all`. `station apps <app>` is one app's detail: its method, its version and the newest that waits (`2.97.0 → 2.98.0`), where it lives, its category and what it brings. `--json` is `station.apps.list/v1`, each app with `name`, `category`, `method`, `state`, `version`, `newest` (with an update only), `lives_on` (`every-machine`, `mac-only`, `vms-only`), `provides` and `detail`.

`install` installs in dependency order, then the settings each app brings; on a terminal its spinner names what runs, and ctrl-c stops it with nothing printed after, exit 130, what finished staying installed. Its outcome opens with the count, the machine and the time (`● Installed 2 apps on This Mac 9s`), then each app with the version and the method that hold it; the pipe keeps the app rows alone. An app already installed says so with its version, `● jq 1.8.1 brew already installed`, exit 0. A bare `update` updates only the apps with an update and says so the same way (`● Updated 3 apps on This Mac`; `● every app is up to date on This Mac` when none); `--method` takes `brew` (brew and cask), `npm`, `bun`, `uv`, `mise` or `skills`, never with names; `--all-machines` updates each Mac and running workspace in turn, says each server and stopped VM it skips, and exits 1 when a Mac does not answer. `remove` asks on a terminal and needs `--yes` off one; an app not installed is refused before anything runs.

The refusals exit 2: `no app named "jqq"`, `dia lives on Macs only` (hint `--on <mac>`), `lazygit is not installed`, `infra is a server: station does not manage its apps`; an app whose method's manager is missing (`keynote needs mas, which is not installed`, hint `station apps install mas`) exits 1. An agent skill is an app: `station apps install frontend-design`. The model is [Apps and skills](tools-and-skills.md).

### `station settings`

```sh
station settings [--all] [--json] # Set by station: applied, changed since, not applied, off here
station settings <setting> [--json] # one setting's detail
station settings diff <setting> # what station would write against what is here
station settings apply [<setting...>] [--yes] # bare = every setting not applied or changed since that asks nothing
station settings off <setting...> [--yes] # off here: station neither applies nor watches it on this machine
```

A setting that needs values asks them in a form on a terminal and is refused elsewhere (exit 2); a value is never an argument. An apply over a setting changed since asks first, as yours is lost; off removes only what is still exactly station's, a change of yours stays. The Always-on Mac group is applied by name only. `station config`, `config install` and `config uninstall` are hidden aliases of `settings`, `settings apply` and `settings off` for one release. See [Configuration](configuration.md).

### `station disk`

```bash
station disk [--json] # the volume, then Misplaced, Can rebuild, Your data, Never touched, with sizes; nothing runs
station disk free [<app...>] # empty what an app can rebuild with its own command; bare = every Can rebuild row
station disk erase <app> [--confirm=<app>] # erase an app's data, back to factory; its name typed
station disk move <folder> # move a misplaced folder where its app's own config says
```

`free` and `move` ask nothing: nothing is lost. `erase` is always one app, its name typed, and refuses while the app runs or on a Never touched row. A stale VM goes with `station machines delete`, an old image version with `station images delete`. The v2 `station storage`, `storage clean` and `storage reset` are hidden aliases for one release. See [Disk](disk.md).

### `station background`

```sh
station background [--all] [--json] # every non-Apple launchd job: Failing, Orphans, then Station, Known apps, Unknown folded
station background remove <label> [--yes] # a task of your own: boot it out and delete its plist
```

An orphan is a task whose program is missing or whose app is gone. `remove` asks on a terminal and needs `--yes` off one; it takes only a user-scope task: a root one is refused, exit 2, with the command to run yourself (station never runs sudo), and the engine's own job is refused with `station engine stop`. A Linux workspace has no job manager station reads, so `--on` one is refused; a macOS workspace lists its own launchd tasks. `--json` is `station.background.list/v1`.

### `station power`

```sh
station power [--json] # the session, its guards, and this Mac's reading (lid, source, battery, thermal)
station power awake [--lid] [--battery] [--for <d>] # keep this host awake: 1m..24h, default 4h; held by the engine
station power sleep # end the session now
```

The engine that already runs holds the session, in memory only: a `PreventUserIdleSystemSleep` assertion, and with `--lid` the clamshell sleep disabled (no root, no `pmset -a`, no file). Every end sets the clamshell back to normal, and so does every engine start and quit. A guard ends the session first: thermal pressure at trapping (or heavy for 5 minutes lid closed on battery), the battery at 20 % on battery, Low Power Mode, or the lid closed on battery without `--battery`; each end is logged in `engine.log` and kept on the page for 24 hours. With `--lid`, a lid close sleeps the display with `pmset displaysleepnow`, never a display assertion. A guard already past its threshold refuses the start (exit 1). Piped, one record per row: the session (`on`, its flags, until in RFC 3339, who asked), the guards, then the reading as `key<TAB>value`. Unrelated to the `restart-after-power-cut` setting, the admin pmset policy of an always-on Mac.

## The fleet

### `station machines`

```sh
station machines [--json] # All machines: every Mac, its VMs under it, then Needs you
station machines <machine> [--json] # that machine's Overview, as station overview --on <machine>
station machines add <mac> [--user <login>] [--key <file>]
station machines forget <mac> [--yes]
station machines create [<name>] [--permanent] [--image linux] [--cpus <n>] [--memory <size>] [--disk <size>] [--network nat|bridged]
station machines create <name> --server [--cpus <n>] [--memory <size>] [--disk <size>] [--check <url|host:port>]
station machines start <vm>
station machines stop <vm> [--yes | --confirm=<name>]
station machines restart <machine> [--yes]
station machines edit <vm> [--cpus <n>] [--memory <size>] [--disk <size>] [--check <url|host:port> | --no-check]
station machines ssh <machine>
station machines delete <vm> [--confirm=<name>]
station machines unlock <mac>
```

`--here` lists This Mac only, with no network. `unlock` is for a Mac waiting at FileVault after a power cut: a Mac that answers already says so (exit 0); otherwise it needs a terminal and dials the Mac on your LAN, at the address it last answered with (Tailscale starts only once its disk is unlocked), where you type the password into macOS's own pre-boot prompt, then waits for the Mac on Tailscale again. `restart <mac>` asks yes or no naming the VMs that pause, sends a planned restart that unlocks itself, waits for its station to answer again (`did not come back`, exit 1, past 3 minutes), starts those VMs again and says how they are. `create` makes a throwaway workspace unless `--permanent` is given, or a server with `--server` (always on, named, behind its Mac, 4 CPU · 8 GB · 50 GB by default; `--check` is its health check, refused on a workspace; `--always-on` is its hidden v2 alias), and asks the Mac on a terminal when two answer; piped it needs no question. `stop` asks a workspace yes or no and a server its name typed (`--confirm=<name>`; `--yes` never answers it), and the VM's own Mac judges the answer. `add` writes the Mac's ssh block, then reaches it as every later call will: a Mac that does not answer, or answers with no station, is not added and nothing stays written; one that runs another station version is added, with how to bring the two to one. `delete` is the only verb that destroys a machine; `forget` only unregisters a Mac, here, whatever `--on` says: it never reaches that Mac, and refuses This Mac and a VM. VMs are made and run on Macs, so these commands are refused on a VM. `create`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `edit` and `delete` need the Mac's engine (`Hint: station engine start`). `station machines <machine>` is that machine's Overview (`probe` is its hidden v2 alias). `--network bridged` is for macOS VMs only. See [Machines](machines.md).

### `station ports`

```sh
station ports [--all-machines] [--all] [--json] # every listening port in its class: Needs you, Public, Private
station ports share <vm> <port> [--json]      # reserve the port now and share it; inside a VM: station ports share <port>
station ports stop-sharing <vm> <port> [--yes] # release it, and do not share it again until a share; inside a VM: <port>
```

`--all-machines` asks every Mac over ssh; `--all` lists the ports that listen on their machine only, otherwise counted on one line. `share` prints the URL before anything listens, piped the URL alone; a port is refused on a VM that shares 20 already (exit 1, `Hint: station ports stop-sharing <vm> <port>`) and while This Mac is signed out of Tailscale (exit 1, the reservation kept). `stop-sharing` asks yes or no and is remembered in `preferences.json` (`services.not_shared`). `--json` is `station.ports.list/v1`. `services`, `services url`, `services release` and `tailnet` are hidden aliases for one release. See [Services](services.md).

### `station images`

```sh
station images [--json] # every Mac's, one row per version per Mac
station images build [<image...>] [--binary <linux station binary>]
station images update [<image...>] # the newest published version
station images delete <image>[@<version>] [--yes]
```

A bare `build` builds every image that is missing or whose recipe changed; a bare `update` updates every image this Mac holds. An image the catalogue does not hold is `no image "debian"` (exit 2). See [Images](images.md).

### `station accounts`

```sh
station accounts [--all-machines] [--json] # who has access to what here, then the shares with VMs
station accounts share <account> --with <vm> [--for <duration>] # 12h by default, 1m to 7d
station accounts take-back <account> --from <vm> [--yes]
```

This Mac's GitHub, npm, Claude, Tailscale, Cloudflare, git, ssh and Docker sign-ins, then `# Shared with VMs`: each share with its VM and its time left. `--on <vm>` reads a workspace's own sign-ins, by its guest; `--all-machines` prints one block per Mac and workspace, a server named and not listed, a stopped workspace and a Mac that does not answer each its own line. Identities and scopes only: no token, cookie or key body is ever read into a value, and anything shaped like one reads `?`. `--json` is `station.accounts.list/v1`: `{schema, machine, accounts, shares, share_list}`. A share is asked of the VM's own Mac. `station secrets`, `secrets lend --to` and `secrets recall --from` are hidden aliases of `accounts`, `accounts share` and `accounts take-back` for one release; `secrets allow` and `disallow` are retired (exit 2). See [Secrets](secrets.md#sharing-accounts).

### `station engine`

```sh
station engine [--json] # running, its version, up, the VMs it runs, Awake; or stopped, since when and by what
station engine stop [--yes] # Stop everything on this Mac: every running workspace stopped, its disk kept; Awake and the sharing end; then the engine, unless a server runs: it is skipped, and the engine keeps running for it
station engine start # the engine bootstrapped again; the VMs it stopped stay stopped
```

`--json` is `station.engine.read/v1`: `{schema, engine: {state, version, up_s, vms, stopped_at, stopped_by}}`, `state` `running`, `stopped` or `not-installed`. An engine running another version than station names both and `station setup`. A Mac only; `--on <mac>` runs it on another Mac. `station stop` and `station start` are hidden aliases of `engine stop` and `engine start` for one release, saying `→ now: station engine stop` on stderr (see [Hidden aliases](#hidden-aliases)). A start the job manager refuses ends in `the engine did not start: <its last word>` (exit 1). See [Machines](machines.md#the-engine).

### The Tailscale line

The first line of `station ports` is This Mac's node: signed in with its name and whether Serve shares, signed out, or not installed. Read only: the owner logs in through the Tailscale app, and station never drives it but for [published services](services.md#serve-and-https).

`station disk free docker` prunes Docker's unused data.

## The binary

```sh
station setup [--name <name>]
station --version
station help [command]
```

`setup` is the one bootstrap verb, safe to run again: it names this Mac (asking the name on a terminal, taking `--name` otherwise; off a terminal, a Mac with no name yet is refused, exit 2, `Hint: station setup --name <name>`), writes the one managed block of `~/.zshrc`, moves `~/.studio/` to the XDG folders, starts the engine, installs this Mac's missing system apps (on a terminal; piped it names them), then applies the Set by station settings that need no value and no admin. The others are listed as next steps, one row each (`next: station settings apply ssh-key`); the Always-on Mac group is opt-in, so setup neither applies nor lists it. Inside a workspace it writes the block and the layout only; inside a server it sets nothing up, the server's own tooling keeps it. `--version` prints `station <version> (<commit>)`. See [Getting started](../start/getting-started.md) and [Dotfiles](dotfiles.md).

## Hidden aliases

A v2 word runs its v3 command with the same arguments, for one release, and prints one muted line on stderr naming it (nothing there with `--json` or `--page`); help and completion never list it.

| Old                                 | Runs                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `station status`                    | `station overview`; `status --json` keeps `station.status/v1`                                                                                                                                                  |
| `station stop`                      | `station engine stop`                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `station tools`                     | `station apps`; `install`, `uninstall` and `upgrade --via` run `apps install`, `apps remove` and `apps update --method`                                                                                        |
| `station secrets`                   | `station accounts`; `lend --to` and `recall --from` run `accounts share --with` and `accounts take-back --from`                                                                                                |
| `station run git <shortcut>`        | `git <alias>`, the [Git shortcuts](configuration.md#the-items) setting's alias (`log`, `push`, `status` are `lg`, `pushup`, `st`); refused with `station settings apply git-shortcuts` while it is not applied |
| `station run docker rm\|rmi\|reset` | the steps of `dclean`, `dclean-images`, `dreset`, the [Docker shortcuts](configuration.md#the-items), asking as before (`--yes` off a terminal)                                                                |

## Plumbing

These commands exist for the machine's own use. They are hidden from help and the owner never types them.

| Command                           | What runs it and what it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `station shell zsh`               | the `~/.zshrc` block evaluates it at every shell start: PATH, the mise activation, station's completion, and in a VM the lent Claude token and the [profiles'](services.md#profiles) exports. Output on stdout only; another shell or none is refused |
| `station shell prompt`            | the prompt's `custom.station` segment runs it: `on linux-1` while this terminal [uses](machines.md#this-terminals-machine) another machine, nothing otherwise; it never counts as a use                                                               |
| `station completion <shell>`      | cobra's completion script, for a shell the block does not serve                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `station engine run`              | the launchd agent `com.jterrazz.station.engine` runs it on a host: the VMs and their services ([Machines](machines.md#the-engine))                                                                                                                    |

`--on` is refused on `shell`, `completion`, `help`, `man`, `use`, `daemon`, `engine run`, `engine attach`, `guest`, `machines pipe` and `machines supervise`: none of them sends a call.

## Exit codes

| Code | Means                                               |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Done                                                |
| 1    | An operation failed, or a confirmation was declined |
| 2    | A refusal, before any question or effect            |

The exit code is computed once, from the error's type (SPEC v3 §12.2): `refused`, `not-found`, `not-for-this-machine`, `needs-confirmation`, `needs-terminal` exit 2; `failed`, `unreachable`, `engine-stopped`, `far-too-old`, `declined` exit 1; `interrupted` exits 130 and prints nothing.
| 130 | Interrupted |

A command over several items prints every outcome, then exits 1 with `<n> of <m> <noun> failed` if any failed.
