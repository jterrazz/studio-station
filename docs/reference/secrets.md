# Secrets

A secret travels only as far as its tier allows: kept on the Mac, shared with a VM as a copy for a time, or bound inside one VM.

## The three tiers

| ------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| kept   | the Mac only                                 | the owner's GitHub token, Apple ID, `AGENT_PASSWORD`           | nothing: it never leaves                                           |
| shared | the Mac; a copy in the VM's credential store | `session:*` browser sessions; the Claude token                 | the copy goes with the disk; the secret stays valid at its provider |
| bound  | inside one VM                                | its ssh host keys, its `github-login` token, a `claude /login` | the disk goes; a token stays valid at its provider until revoked   |

Deleting a VM is not revoking a token. Use fine-grained, expiring tokens in a VM, and revoke at the provider.

## Sharing accounts

`share_list` in `~/.config/station/preferences.json` names the secrets whose accounts may be shared, written by hand: a name, or a family as `session:*`. A Mac whose preferences name none shares `session:*` and `operator:claude:oauth-token`; a v2 `lend_list` is read while no `share_list` is written. An account whose secret the list does not hold is refused (`npm is not on the share list`, exit 2). `station secrets allow` and `disallow` are retired: they exit 2 with the share list as their hint.

```sh
station accounts share github --with api            # for 12h; sharing again resets the term
station accounts share claude --with api --for 4h   # a term from 1m to 7d
station accounts take-back github --from api        # delete the VM's copy, after a y/n (--yes off a terminal)
station accounts                                    # names and scopes, never a value
```

A share is refused before anything is read or copied: an unknown account or VM, a stopped VM (`api is stopped`, hint `station machines start api`), a server (`infra is a server: station shares no account with it`), a VM of another Mac (`ci-1 is on mac-mini: share from mac-mini's accounts`, its hint the same command `--on mac-mini`), an account not signed in on this Mac. An export the studio CLI fails is `GitHub could not be read on This Mac` (exit 1): nothing is copied, no share is kept, and the studio CLI's own words go to `~/.local/state/station/logs/accounts.log`, the file the hint names.

A shared copy is a snapshot: later captures on the Mac do not reach it until you share again. Every share ends by itself: `~/.local/state/station/shares.json` keeps, per VM, each secret shared, when and until when (`accounts --json` lists them under `shares`), and at its until the engine takes the copy back from a VM whose guest is connected (at its start and every minute; a VM still connecting, or stopped past its until, has it taken back as its guest connects, before it is reported ready), with no notification. A take-back that fails keeps its share and is told once an hour. `machines delete` drops the VM's shares with its disk. The shares a v2 VM record held move into `shares.json` once, at `station setup`. Values pass between the credential stores through a pipe, never through argv and never to disk on the Mac. A share and a take-back run inside the VM over the engine's one connection to it, so they need the engine up and the VM's guest connected.

`station secrets`, `secrets lend --to <vm>` and `secrets recall --from <vm>` are hidden aliases for one release: they run `accounts`, `accounts share` (each account the share list holds, or each secret named) and `accounts take-back`, naming the v3 command on stderr; `secrets --json` is `station.accounts.list/v1`.

## Where to revoke

| Secret                               | Revoke at                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A VM's GitHub token                  | github.com, your account page for developer tokens and authorized apps                         |
| A shared `session:*` browser session | log out of that provider in the Mac's browser; the provider's session list shows the others    |
| The Claude token                     | claude.ai, your account page for sessions and tokens; then `station settings off claude-token` |

## Studio in a VM

A share uses the studio CLI's credential store on both ends (`studio credentials export`, `import`, `delete`), because that store has one owner. A VM without `studio` on its PATH makes `accounts share` fail with a hint to this section. How the studio CLI reaches a VM is not designed yet ([TODO](../../TODO.md)); until then, sharing is judged with stubs.

## Claude in a VM

A VM cannot open a browser on your Mac to log in, so the Mac shares it a token.

1. On the Mac, once: `claude setup-token`. It opens a browser OAuth and prints a long-lived subscription token.
2. `station settings apply claude-token`. A form asks for the token, the OS credential store keeps it as `operator:claude:oauth-token` (in the keychain on a Mac), and the name joins the share list.
3. `station accounts share claude --with <vm>` copies it.
4. Inside the VM, `station shell zsh` exports `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from the VM's credential store at every shell start. With no `studio`, no name or any failure it prints nothing: a shell start never fails.

`station accounts take-back claude --from <vm>`, the share's end and `machines delete` remove the VM's copy; `station settings off claude-token` deletes the Mac's and takes the name off the share list. Revoke the token itself at claude.ai.

The alternative is a bound login: run `claude /login` inside a permanent workspace. The login lives and dies with that VM and is never shared.

## Accounts

`station accounts` (a machine's Accounts section in the TUI) shows who has access to what: each provider's identity on this Mac, then on each of its VMs, and where the right comes from: `own` (a login done on that machine), `lent` (a shared copy, with its `until`), or both; then `# Shared with VMs`, each share with its VM and its time left. A share in its last hour is `◐ expiring` with the `accounts share` command that renews it; an ended one the engine could not take back is `✗ failing` with the `accounts take-back` command. A VM is read by its own guest over the engine's session, so no provider's output ever leaves the VM: only the parsed identities and scopes do. Each provider's read is an allowlist of named fields (`src/accounts/adapter/cli/parse.go`), and every kept value that looks like a token (`gh*_`, `github_pat_`, `sk-ant-`, `npm_`, `xox*-`, a JWT, 32 and more characters of base64 or hex) is replaced by `?`.
